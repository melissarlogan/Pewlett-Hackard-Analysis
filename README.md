# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The below analysis has been prepared for Pewlett-Hackard in response to their aging workforce. This analysis has been done to analyze the workforce that will be retiring shortly and analyzing what this means for the company when all these individuals leave the company.
## Results
Four key findings from the analysis are detailed and described below:
-The retiring_titles.csv shows us that there are only 2 managers that will be retiring soon. This is helpful for Pewlett-Hackard given that management roles are typically overseeing mutiple people and are harder to train for. This means that  replacing only 2 individuals will not be strenuous on the company as a whole.
-The retiring_titles.csv shows  90,398 individuals are approaching the retirement age, it is noted above that only 2 are in manager roles, this is interesting for Pewlett-Hackard as typically older, more experienced individuals are in  management positions rather than senior roles. 
-Of the 90,398 individuals retiring  57,668 or (63.79%) are in “Senior” (Senior Engineer, Senior Staff). This suggests that replacing these individuals will be more difficult given they require some training and expertise  
- Pewlett-Hackard has 300,024 employees- 90,398 retirement eligible employees represents 30.13% of their workforce. They have 1,549 individuals born in 1965 eligible for the mentorship program which will likely be insufficient to train the 209,602 employees not eligible for retirement.

## Summary
Pewlett-Hackard needs to create a plan for transitioning these employees out of the workforce given the large % portion they make up of their workforce.

### Roles Needed
The company will need the 90,398 roles to be filled as these individuals retire. It should be noted that as each cohort retires and ages out of the workforce, that another cohort gets another year closer to retiring meaning that this 90,398 will likely change over the years as more birth years come into the retirement zone. 
### Next Generation
There are only 1,549 individuals in the mentorship eligibility group, this represents only 0.52% of the company and will not be enough to mentor the next generation.

### Additional Tables
1. A query showing the distribution of employees by birthyear to indicate what the next generation is for Pewlett-Hackard and if this will be a problem for those birth years after than 1952-1955
2. A query showing the average tenure of employees and how long they typically stay with the company. Turn-over by age group would be helpful when setting aside future budgets and expectations based on staffing ages
